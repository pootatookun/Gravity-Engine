# Gravity-Engine

This piece of code simulates Universal Law of Gravitation, between N particles. 
Made using python and Kivy

Key Features:  
1. Can add N particles
2. You can set distance between masses.
3. Shows real time acceleration
4. And has a nice scroolview, which shows particles and their accelerations :)
5. A reload button


Microsoft Defender or any other anivirus/malware, might tag Executable as virus.
Disable real time protection, before extracting the zip. Then if needed(after re-enabling) add the 
extracted folder into exclusion list of defender  :P


CAUTION: Use 'Doubel click to exit' to exit the program, if simulation is running.
	 	 or Click 'Reload' then exit by closing the program window.
	 	 Or the program will freeze and you will have to kill it using task manager


How to use:

1. Mark a particle on the blank left side.
2. After the press, a popup will ask for mass of that particle. Enter mass and hit enter
3. Repeat step 1,2 for n number of particles
   OR Hit the "Random Mass" button and it will feed Mass(0-900000000) into program,
   Then mark points
4. Enter the distance between farthest particles, in field 'Farthest-Particles(m)' and press enter.
   Distance is in meters. It's the distance the user want between the farthest particles. 
   These two particles are determined by the program itself. 
5. Click on 'Begin Fun' to start simulation.

	SET MULTIPLIER  does nothing in this version
-------Be sure to check in your task manager, what is eating your cpu ;)
